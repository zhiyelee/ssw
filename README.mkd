Features
--------
 *  **Notification status visible at all times**.  You no longer have to scroll
    the page to the top and you don't have to keep going back to the browser
    tab with Google+.  You will always know when you get new notifications
    because the browser button is always visible with a badge.
 *  **Collapsible comments**. Thanks to a side bar always within view, it's quick
    and easy to hide hundreds of comments from anywhere in the discussion.
 *  **Collapsible posts**.  You can hide and unhide a post without muting it.
    This is great if you're not really interested in seeing a post and all its
    comments right now, but you still want to get back to it at a later time.
    The downside of muting a post is that you will never see it again and
    you stop getting any notifications of responses to any comments you may
    have made on that post.
 *  **Mark comments as read**. Collapsing posts/comments automatically
    keeps track of the comments you've seen; the extension remembers.
 *  **Real-time comment count on collapsed items**.  Whether you like to collapse
    comments or posts, you won't miss any incoming comments.  The extension shows you
    the total number of seen or unseen comments, updated live.
 *  **List-mode option keeps at most one post displayed**.  Combined with
    real-time comments, this turns the stream into a dashboard: in one
    screenful you can see activity on many posts at once and jump back and
    forth between multiple active comment streams. This will greatly benefit
    those who follow popular people who post a lot and/or get a lot of comments.
 *  **Mouse-over instant preview**.  In list mode, hover the mouse over a
    collapsed post to get a preview of the content at the side.  The preview is fully
    functional.

Known Issues
------------
 *  Does not play well with the 'j' and 'k' keyboard shortcuts, which scroll
    the page.
 *  Sometimes the comment counts look odd. You can get zero or negative counts
    for new comments because people delete their comments -- that's normal. But
    Google+ doesn't give us comments consistently.
